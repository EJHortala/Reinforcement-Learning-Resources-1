## [Libraries](#Reinforcement-Learning-Resources)

* pyqlearning- Pyqlearning is a Python library to implement RL, especially for Q-Learning and multi-agent Deep Q-Network. This library makes it possible to design the information search algorithm such as the Game AI, web crawlers, or robotics.[[github](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Reinforcement-Learning/pyqlearning)]

* KerasRL - Keras-RL seamlessly implements state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms with the deep learning library Keras. Evaluating and playing around with different algorithms is easy, as Keras-RL works with OpenAI Gym out of the box.[[github](https://github.com/keras-rl/keras-rl)]

* TensorForce - is an open-source deep reinforcement learning framework, which is relatively straightforward in its usage. Tensorforce is built on top of Googleâ€™s TensorFlow framework and is compatible with Python 3. [[github](https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce)]

* RL_Coach - Reinforcement Learning Coach (RL_Coach) by Intel AI Lab enables easy experimentation with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. The Coach can be used directly from python, where it uses the presets mechanism to define the experiments. A preset is mostly a python module which instantiates a graph manager object. [[github](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/coach)]

* chainerRL - ChainerRL is a deep RL library that implements various state-of-the-art deep reinforcement algorithms in Python using Chainer, which is a flexible deep learning framework. [[github](https://github.com/chainer/chainerrl)]

* MAME RL - thislibrary enables users to train your reinforcement learning algorithms on almost any arcade game. The toolkit allows the algorithm to step through gameplay while receiving the frame data, along with sending actions, making it more interactive with the game. [[github](https://github.com/M-J-Murray/MAMEToolkit)]

* MushroomRL - is a Python reinforcement learning library whose modularity allows to use well-known Python libraries for tensor computation (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow) and RL benchmarks (e.g. OpenAI Gym, PyBullet, Deepmind Control Suite). [[github](https://github.com/MushroomRL/mushroom-rl)]

* pytorch_rl - is a library purely written in python to implement all the algorithms like SARSA, DQN, etc using pytorch module.[[github](https://github.com/jingweiz/pytorch-rl)]

* rlput - Modular, optimized implementations of common deep RL algorithms in PyTorch, with unified infrastructure supporting all three major families of model-free algorithms: policy gradient, deep-q learning, and q-function policy gradient. [[github](https://github.com/astooke/rlpyt)]

* cherry - Cherry is a reinforcement learning framework for researchers built on top of PyTorch. [[github](https://github.com/learnables/cherry)]

* rllab - rllab is a framework for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms. It includes a wide range of continuous control tasks plus implementations of the following algorithms. [[github](https://github.com/rll/rllab)]

* openAI baselines - OpenAI Baselines is a set of high-quality implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms. [[github](https://github.com/openai/baselines)]

* CURL - is the official implementation of CURL for the DeepMind control experiments. [[github](https://github.com/MishaLaskin/curl)]
